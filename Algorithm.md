## Main function
    - Ask for input_file name, left_margin, and right_margin from the user.
    - Check for non-empty input_file name and non-negative left_margin and right_margin.
    - Call makeMargin function with checked user supplied arguments.

## makeMargin function
    - Open input_file in 'read' mode.
    - Create a list of all the words in the file.
    - Remove any empty string item from the list. 
    - Open DAT1.TXT file to write the output in.
    - Initialize variable written_char which will have the count of number of characters written in that line.
    - Initialize word_count variable which will point to the word to be written in the file.
    - While written_char <= 80 and word_index < len(words)
        - Get the word to write.
        - If written_char is 0, nothing has been written in the line, so,
            - Write the left_margin.
            - Increment written_char.
        - If availble spaces more than word length:
            - Write word.
            - Increment written_char.
            -If last char written is a period:
                - If two char spaces available:
                    - Write two spaces.
                - Else (Only one char space is available.):
                    - Write one space.
            - Else if last char written is new line char:
                - Update the value of written_char to 0 as a new line has to be written.
            - Else:
                - Write a space.
            - Increment the word_count as next word has to be written.
        - Else if available spaces exactly equal to lenth of word to be written:
            - Write the word.
            - Increment word_count as next word has to be written in next iteration.
            - Write the right_margin.
            - Write a new line char.
            - Update written_char to 0 as new line will be started next.
        - Else if available spaces is less than the current word length:
            - Write space char in the remaining spaces and write right_margin.
            - Write a new line char.
        - Close output file.
